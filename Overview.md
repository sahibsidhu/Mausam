## Installation

We use the `react-accessible-accordion` (for enhancing the user experience) and `react-select-async-paginate` (for city search functionality) packages in your app, you need to follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal and navigate to your project directory.

2. Run the following command to install the `react-accessible-accordion` package:

    ```bash
    npm install react-accessible-accordion
    ```

    or if you're using Yarn:

    ```bash
    yarn add react-accessible-accordion
    ```

3. Next, install the `react-select-async-paginate` package by running the following command:

    ```bash
    npm install react-select-async-paginate
    ```

    or if you're using Yarn:

    ```bash
    yarn add react-select-async-paginate
    ```

4. Once the installation is complete, you can import and use the components from these packages in your React application.

    For example, to use the `Accordion` component from `react-accessible-accordion`, you can import it as follows:

    ```jsx
    import { Accordion } from 'react-accessible-accordion';
    ```

    Similarly, to use the `AsyncPaginate` component from `react-select-async-paginate`, you can import it like this:

    ```jsx
    import AsyncPaginate from 'react-select-async-paginate';
    ```

That's it! You have successfully installed the `react-accessible-accordion` and `react-select-async-paginate` packages in your app. You can now start using their components in your React components.
